    analogies = the txt file containing the analogy questions of one of the four
    top categories of IceBATS. 
    vectors = the kv file containing the vectors of the trained language model
    to be evaluated. 

    This function is heavily inspired by the function evaluate_word_analogies
    from Gensim's KeyedVectors. It starts by loading the vectors of the model to
    be used (either w2v, fastText or GloVe (GloVe vectors need to be converted 
    to w2v format)) and then evaluates the analogy questions of one of the four
    top categories of the Icelandic Bigger Analogy Test Set, IceBATS, using the
    vector offset method provided by Gensim. Each of the 10 subcategories is 
    evaluated individually as well as the category as a whole. The function 
    prints the evaluations for each subcategory to the console. It returns the 
    total evaluation score of the category. It also keeps track of the proportion 
    of questions that contain out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words and prints it to 
    the console.
    
    The biggest deviation from the original Gensim function is that this modified
    version allows for multiple possible answers to an analogy question. For example,
    in the question 'snow is for white is like grass is for what?', the answer could
    be green, yellow or brown, depending on the condition of the grass. This function
    therefore iterates through every possible quadruple combination from multiple
    options (when provided) and if the predicted outcome is the same as one of the
    options, the question is considered to be correctly answered. Likewise, when
    checking for OOV words within the question, the OOV count is only raised if 
    all of the possible combinations include OOV words. We also drop the condition
    that the answer d to a question a:b::c:d cannot be one of the a, b and c words
    as it can be the case that the most correct answer is to be found within that
    group of words (e.g. 'USA is to English is like Britain is to what?')."""
